/**
 * A configuration for a single IIonFieldWriter (used internally by the IonObjectWriter).
 *
 * An IIonObjectWriterConfigurator can read the <code>field</code> field to see what field (field writer)
 * this configuration is for.
 *
 * The fieldName of the field is stored in the <code>fieldName</code> field (but is also accessible
 * via field.getName()).
 *
 * The <code>include</code> field defaults to true, but can be set to false. The IonObjectWriter will then not
 * include a field writer for this field, meaning that field will not be included in the written ION data.
 *
 * The <code>alias</code> field can be used to give the field a different fieldName in the written ION data than the
 * field has in the Java object.
