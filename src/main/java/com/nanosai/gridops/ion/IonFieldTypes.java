      The two reserved types will be used for either:

        UTF_8 - 0 to 15 bytes
        UTF_8 - 16 to 31 bytes
        DATETIME
        TIME
        DURATION

      Which one we choose will be determined after measuring a lot of data traffic going through VStack

      Extended types:
       - DATETIME
       - TIME
       - DURATION

       Note that it does not make sense to represent UTF_8 (0 to 15 bytes) and UTF_8 (16 to 31 bytes) as extended
       types. The one byte these types save, the lose again with the type extension byte.
